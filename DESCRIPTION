Description: CZVV neither publishes a REST API nor provides exam data in
    easy-to-process JSON or XML formats. Instead, the data are published
    in separate XLSX files that are difficult to access programmatically
    because the links are dynamically generated by an ASP.NET server. This
    package provides a simple R API that allows you to gather links to all
    available exam data files and returns them in a tidy table.
